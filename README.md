 # Introduction

In every organization, people are its beating heart, driving progress, creativity, and success. 

- But what happens when people leave?                                                                                           
- What motivates them to stay? 

The HR Analytics Dashboard was created to answer these pressing questions. By using data to tell the story of our workforce, this project bridges the gap between numbers and the lives they represent.

 # Skills demonstrated for the project

- Proficiency in Power BI Desktop for creating interactive dashboards.
- Expertise in data cleaning and data transformation for ensuring data integrity.
- Knowledge of data modeling to establish relationships between datasets.
- Analytical skills for deriving insights from complex datasets.
- Visualization techniques to present data trends effectively.

# Problem Statement

At its core, this project addresses a human challenge: 

Why do talented individuals leave, and how can we help them stay?

Organization faced questions like:

- What can we do today to create a workplace that people won’t want to leave tomorrow?
- Which demographic groups or roles are most affected by attrition?
- How does job satisfaction correlate with staying power?

These questions guided every step of the journey.

The goal is to move beyond the numbers to address these challenges with clarity and purpose.

# Data Transformation/Cleaning/Modeling

- No Required Data Cleaning for this Dataset.
  
- No Modeling was required since I need just a table for the analysis.

Insight

- High attrition is observed among employees aged 26–35 and those with less than 5 years at the company.
- Roles like research scientists and sales executives show low job satisfaction, which could lead to higher turnover.
- There is a gender imbalance, with more male employees than females.

Recommendations

- Focus on career development, mentorship, and clear progression paths for employees aged 26–35 and those with under 5 years at the company.
- Improve job satisfaction for research scientists and sales executives through training, recognition, and flexible work options.
- Offer professional development for employees in high-turnover sectors like life sciences and medical fields.
- Implement inclusive hiring and mentorship programs to address the gender gap.

# Conclusion:

The HR Analytics Dashboard painted a clear picture of the workforce’s current state, highlighting both opportunities and challenges. It emphasized the importance of targeted strategies to improve retention, satisfaction, and overall organizational health.
